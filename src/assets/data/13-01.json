        "explain": "Stratosphere mobile communication system, using HAP hovering in the stratosphere long-time as the carrying platform, carrying mobile communication 4G base station, provides wideband transmission service for the mobile stations on the ground, on the sea and in the air.Stratosphere mobile communication system, as the base equipment hovering long-time in the air, which is the third area communication network making method beside land mobile communication and satellite communication, is fit for the mobile communication interfere in the remote area, on the sea and emergency, with large volume, low reduction, short-time delay, large range, convenient arrangement, quick construction and low price.Near-space communication hover-in-the-air aircraft is specially designed for lightweight communication load and area coverage of communication support. As the base station of Stratosphere mobile communication system, through floating in the air, it can be used to hover in the area and in Stratosphere long-time, carry small mobile communication base station, and make network using the platform to construct the area message net. For its short-time preparation of flight and high ability for emergency, the aircraft can be arranged as the base equipment along the belt and road, to make up the large area mobile communication network around the air or sea route and the economy strip.",
